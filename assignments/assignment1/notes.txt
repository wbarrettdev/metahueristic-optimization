It's not in your own words, like, I'm not looking for any formal write-up or anything, I'm just saying, okay, so…
I ran…
these three values for the probability crossover, this is what I was expecting, that, you know, if you don't do much crossover, this is what happens, and here we see…
You know, the results either matched it or they didn't match it.

So I've been saying as well, a nice thing to look at would be the, you know, for a sample run with the default. So let's just say the first run with the default. So, like, run all your experiments, gather your data, and then run one last experiment where you just do one run, maybe, and you output the…
iteration where every time it finds an improving solution. So that we can see… so then you would plot, over time how that solution improved. Is it that it gets really close to the optimum in the first 5 generations, and then barely improves at all?
Or is it that it was making a constant improvement, or is it that it didn't make any improvement for ages? That sort of thing. So to just plot that. Another one that might be nice to plot…
But it would take a little bit more… a small bit more coding would be the…
Across each… for each generation, after you generate each one, you compute the average of the solution quality across the population, just to see, well, is the… we might be getting better solutions, but actually the population isn't… as a whole, isn't actually improving.
